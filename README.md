# theplayer

He does very few things but he does them very well.
They tell you when the machine is published but not when you connect
Tired of repeating the same processes in the initial stages
# All this has a solution and instantly 3 mins you pwnd user in bizness, just run thearena and you will be connected with the initial tools launched and with that data deciding the true first attack.

Enjoy

For first three days use thearena.
For the rest use theseason.
To run you need to add your jwt token in the code.

The player goes to stan by until new order
